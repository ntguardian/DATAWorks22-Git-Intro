# DATAWorks 2022 Introduction to Git

This is a Git tutorial showing basic Git usage, including creating a repo,
adding and tracking files, pushing/pulling from the repo, branching, and
merging.

To demonstrate this project, I will work an exercise from Simon Wood's book,
*Generalized additive models; An introduction with R (2nd ed.)*. The exercise
concerns using generalized additive models (GAMs) for calibrating satellite
remote sensed data via comparing remote sensed chlorophyll in the ocean via
satellite with direct chlorophyll measurement. That exercise will be an R
exercise in a `.Rmd` file, along with some accompanying `.R` files to ease
analysis.

The purpose of this repo is not the analysis itself but Git usage, so not much
will be explained.
